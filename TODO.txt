    [?] Bug: Software blit doesnt work in fullscreen mode after I added OpenGL context
    {
        HACK(KARAN): stretchdibits doesn't work in fullscreen mode when the window has an opengl context.
            So when in fullscreen mode and if we have a glContext, 
            use opengl texture rendering path.
    }
    [x] Bug: ALT + TAB to other window doesn't send ALT key up to the current Window. 
	Thus syncronization is required for when focus is gained/lost.
